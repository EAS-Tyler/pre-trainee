# HASHING   

Here I created a User Account Management program with an interactive menu system allowing the user to:
- Register an account
    - Creating a unique username
    - Creating a password (with confirmation)
- Log in (Inputing username and password), allowing the user to:
    - Change password (with confirmation)
    - Delete account
    - Log out
- Exit

All actions are informative with appropriate error messages, and all passwords are hashed to user database (theuser_accounts.json)

### What I learned:
- How to use readline effectively 
- Hashing passwords 
- Writing back to files, using JSON.stringify
- How to use functions more effectively - using a menu system, calling functions within other functions and variable parameters specific to the user e.g. function entNewPass(i)
- splice function on arrays 
- How to utilise "push" function
