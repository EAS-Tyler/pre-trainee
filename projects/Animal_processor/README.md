# Animal_processor
My first complete code written

For this task I created a Node.js script (Processor.js) to:
- Read and parse data from a json file (animaldata.json)
- Use readline to receive user input 
- Create a menu system using functions and if statements
- Output information


### What I Learned:
- How to effectively use for loops
- How to effectively use is statements
- Handling data to make it informative
